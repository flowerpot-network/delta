### Software Engineer, Oscoin

* **Location**: Berlin
* **Commitment**: Full-time
* **Compensation**: 100'000 EUR/year + equity[^1]
* **Paid vacation**: 30 days

At Monadic, the team behind oscoin, we're hiring our first engineers. We're
looking for experienced candidates who are well versed in functional
programming and distributed systems. We'd like to speak to people who are
empathetic, humble, passionate about their work and strive for excellence.

Currently, all of our efforts are focused on building the reference
implementation of [oscoin](http://oscoin.io), an open-source protocol and
network for decentralized code hosting and collaboration which aims to make
open-source development more sustainable.

Everything we build is open-source. Our language of choice is Haskell. You will
be tasked to build and deploy fault-tolerant distributed systems based on
cryptographic proofs, authenticated data-structures and distributed-ledger
technologies.

You will have to keep up to date with recent developments in the field; the
ability to read research papers and produce working implementations is
essential. You will have to be an excellent communicator, both in oral and
written form.

We invest in people primarly, not technologies: if you are a seasoned software
engineer but lack experience with some of the tools, technologies or languages
we use, we can get you up to speed.

At Monadic, the culture is the people we hire. We have core tenets which you
will learn about and help shape, but these revolve principally around how we
treat each other and what standards we try to meet when working together.

We are currently looking for engineers in the following areas:

1. Protocol and distributed-systems engineering in Haskell.
2. Frontend web engineering and prototyping. For this work, we favor candidates
with experience in Elm, React, Purescript or Vue, and a good eye for design.

If you'd like to apply, please send us an email at <jobs@monadic.xyz> with
your résumé and links to or samples of work you've done; we especially value
open-source contributions.

[^1]: The starting salary is equal for all employees, including founders,
  regardless of location. We believe in having a level playing field for
  everyone and in keeping the team small. Equity is negotiable based on
  experience.
