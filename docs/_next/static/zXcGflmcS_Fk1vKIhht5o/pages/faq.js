Therefore, we created AccessP2P to build a library of introductory materials and host a small cohort to take advantage of a supportive peer group and the growing network of Berlin-based mentors and experts. While we believe that this is a good starting point for increasing the diversity of those entering the P2P space, we are aware that we might not get everything right.
